### Background

I'm a senior backend engineer with around six years of experience building and running scalable distributed systems. I enjoy working end to end on problems, from shaping the system design and architecture to shipping code and keeping things healthy in production. I care a lot about building software that's reliable, easy to maintain, and practical in the real world.

Outside of work, I love traveling and have visited 24 countries so far. One of my most memorable experiences was traveling to Svalbard, where I visited the northernmost point of the world. When I'm not traveling, I enjoy experimenting in the kitchen and closely following Formula 1—usually with plenty of opinions from my couch.

### Connect

I'm always interested in hearing from other developers, potential collaborators, or anyone who shares my passion for building great software. Feel free to reach out!
