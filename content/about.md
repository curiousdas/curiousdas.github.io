## Beyond Work

Outside of work, I love traveling and have visited **24 countries** so far. One of my most memorable experiences was traveling to Svalbard, where I visited the northernmost point of the world.

When I'm not traveling, I enjoy experimenting in the kitchen and closely following **Formula 1**—usually with plenty of opinions from my couch.
