I’m a senior backend engineer with around six years of experience building and running scalable distributed systems. I like working end to end on problems, from designing systems and writing code to shipping features and keeping things running smoothly in production. Lately, I’ve been tinkering a lot with LLMs and agent-based systems, exploring and experimenting with what they can do.

## Beyond Work

Outside of work, I love traveling and have visited **24 countries** so far.

When I'm not traveling, I enjoy experimenting in the kitchen and closely following **Formula 1**, usually with plenty of opinions from my couch.
